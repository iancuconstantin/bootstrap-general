## What I`ve learned:

- Using Bootstrap
- Using components
- Styling components
- Making sites responsive

## Tasks

1. Create a homepage for your website. It should have a carousel showing three slides about your business and two cards with a picture and some text describing them.
    - The website has a homepage
    - There's a carousel with three or more slides on the page
    - There are two cards, each with a picture and some text on the page

2. List five important values for your business in a horizontally aligned list at the bottom of the `Home page`, and explain them. Make sure long values get truncated. Add a motivational blockquote after the list, and make the quote right-aligned.
    - Five values are listed in a horizontally aligned list
    - The long values are truncated in the list
    - There's a right-aligned blockquote at the bottom

3. Add a new page containing a registration form. The form should ask for a `Name`, `Password`, `Country` and `Gender`. `Name` should use a simple textbox, but `Password` shouldn't show the password when typing. The `Country` should be selectable from 5 options. The `Gender` should be selectable using two radios, one labeled `Male`, the other labeled `Female`. The form should also have a button to `Register`.
    - There's a second page containing the registration form

4. Add another page with a simple login form, which asks for a `Name`, `Password` and a checkbox showing whether you want the site to `Remember my password`. Also add a button for `Login`.
    - There's a third page containing the login form

5. Make sure, that the forms look different on different screen sizes on the `Registration` page.
    - On extra small screens, each input field is in a different row
    - On small screens, the `Name` and `Password` fields are in the same row and are the same length
    - On medium screens, the `Name` field is shorter than the `Password` field, and they are in different rows

6. Add a navbar to the top of each page, so you can access all pages from any page.
    - There's a navbar at the top of each page
    - The navbar can be used to access any of the three pages

7. [OPTIONAL] Make the form pages look better by placing the forms in a card and centering them on the page.
    - Both forms are inside of a card
    - Both forms are in the center of the page
